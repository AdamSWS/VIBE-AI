As a result, we have translate them into some sort of numerical value. The most common practice is to use something called One-Hot-Encoding, which is fine if you don't have many options for each category. However, if you have a lot of options, things get out of hand quickly. This is where methods like Target Encoding really start to shine, so that's what we'll talk about today.

So when we minimize the cost function we ensure that we minimize the sum of the weights.So no parameters gets higher values. Moreover, parameters for variables or factors that are less important get a value of 0, which is to say these variables play no role in the final model. So regularization can also be considered as a automated feature selection techniques as un important variables get removed from the model.\"\n",
